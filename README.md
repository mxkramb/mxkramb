### Hi there 👋 I'm a Platform Engineer & DevOps Enthusiast

I specialize in **infrastructure automation**, **Kubernetes orchestration**, and building **self-healing systems**. My focus is on reducing deployment friction and increasing system reliability through code.

### 🔭 What I Do

* **Infrastructure as Code:** I don't click buttons. I write Terraform/OpenTofu and Ansible to provision environments in minutes, not days.
* **Zero-Downtime Deployments:** I implement rolling updates and automated rollbacks using K8s Operators and Argo CD.
* **Observability:** I architect full-stack monitoring solutions (Prometheus/Grafana/OpenTelemetry) to reduce Mean-Time-To-Detect (MTTD).
* **Process Automation:** Utilizing tools like n8n and Python to automate repetitive Ops tasks.

### 📈 GitHub Stats

Since most of the heavy lifting is performed in the dark, my public stats are limited. As I strongly believe in transparency and clean work ethics, I will provide them anyway. But this is just the tip of the iceberg. I promise you: There is more than meets the eye and a lot more to come in the future.
